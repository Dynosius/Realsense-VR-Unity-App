# Realsense-VR-Unity-App


This is a project I did for my bachelors degree.  
It Included using various technologies such as:

- Unity
- Orbbec Astra
- Intel Realsense R200 (dropped in favor of the better sensor)
- Oculus Rift DK2

### Purpose of the project

The purpose of this specific project was to develop an application that would be used  
to help patients with motor disabilities to exercize and develop those skills in an  
entertaining manner.  

The application that was developed included several mini-games that are simple and fun to use  
in a VR environment, while also using a body tracking sensor (Orbbec Astra).


### Demo
